 Chrome Extension Excercise
Just trying to create a basic Extension that will
    check if the youtube link playing is tagged as music
    gets the name of the youtube video
    does google search with that name + lyrics
    pulls the lyrics
    displays it on demand 

To try this Extension download all the files -> go to chrome -> Extensions chrome://extensions/ -> load unpacked -> navigate to the folder -> click the extension in the extension bar -> select auto display lyrics :)
